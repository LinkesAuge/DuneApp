- ✅ `app_settings` - System configuration (unified)
- ✅ `hagga_basin_base_maps` - Map backgrounds
- ✅ `hagga_basin_overlays` - Map layers
- ✅ Items & Schematics tables (15 tables) - Complete system
- ✅ `shared_images` - Universal image library

### **Removed Tables** (Cleanup):
- ❌ `custom_icons` - Custom POI type icons
- ❌ `poi_collections` - User POI collections
- ❌ `poi_collection_items` - Collection memberships
- ❌ `collection_shares` - Collection sharing

### **Settings Configuration**:

## Migration Guidelines

### **Rollback Strategy**:
The cleanup migrations are designed to be **non-reversible** as they remove unused functionality. However, core POI data is preserved and can be restored from backups if needed.

### **Future Migrations**:
- All future schema changes should maintain the simplified structure
- Avoid reintroducing custom POI complexity
- Maintain unified settings approach for new features
- Document any changes to core POI functionality

### **Backup Verification**:
- ✅ Pre-migration backup created
- ✅ Core POI data verified intact
- ✅ User profiles preserved
- ✅ Items & Schematics data maintained
