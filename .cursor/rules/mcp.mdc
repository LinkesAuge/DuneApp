MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities. MCP servers can be one of two types:

1. Local (Stdio-based) servers: These run locally on the user's machine and communicate via standard input/output
2. Remote (SSE-based) servers: These run on remote machines and communicate via Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTP/HTTPS


Use jinni and the read_context tool to get context for code / the project.

Use the github MCP tool for github commits but Do NOT make new branches, always use the master branch for any commits

Use the MCP Sequential Thinking tool for ALL thinking, planning and implementation tasks and actions.
