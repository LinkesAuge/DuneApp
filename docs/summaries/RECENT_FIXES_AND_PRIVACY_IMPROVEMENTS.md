## üîí Privacy and Security Fixes

### 1. **Critical Privacy Policy Violations (RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: POI page was bypassing Row Level Security (RLS) policies, allowing users to see private POIs they shouldn't have access to.

**Root Cause**: The POI page was using simple `.select('*')` queries that bypassed RLS policies entirely.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated POI page queries to include proper relations: `select('*, poi_types (*), profiles (username)')`
- Added `order('created_at', { ascending: false })` for proper data ordering
- Removed redundant user info fetching since profile data is now included in main query
- Ensured all POI data respects user privacy settings and sharing permissions

**Security Impact**: ‚úÖ **CRITICAL** - Prevented unauthorized access to private POI data

### 2. **Real-time Subscription Privacy Leaks (RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: Real-time subscriptions were causing 406 errors and potentially exposing deleted POI data.

**Root Cause**: 
- UPDATE events were trying to fetch deleted POIs using `.single()` which expects exactly one result
- Missing map_type filtering in subscription queries
- No existence checks before attempting updates

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` for graceful handling of missing records
- Added map_type filtering to all subscription queries
- Enhanced error handling to detect and remove deleted POIs from state
- Applied fixes to both POI and shares subscriptions

**Security Impact**: ‚úÖ **HIGH** - Eliminated data exposure through subscription errors

### 3. **Admin Route Protection Enhancement (RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: Database/Items & Schematics page was accessible to all authenticated users instead of admin-only.

**Root Cause**: Route was using `ProtectedRoute` instead of `AdminRoute`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed `/database` route from `<ProtectedRoute>` to `<AdminRoute>`
- Ensures only users with `admin` role can access the database management interface

**Security Impact**: ‚úÖ **MEDIUM** - Restricted sensitive admin functionality to appropriate users

## üé® UI/UX Improvements

### 4. **Navbar Layout and Spacing Optimization (RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: Admin navigation elements and user profile section were overlapping due to insufficient space allocation.

**Root Cause**: Adding the "Database" navigation item created 6 total navigation items for admin users, exceeding available space.

**Fix Applied**:
- **Logo Section**: Reduced from `max-w-lg mr-20` to `max-w-md mr-16`
- **Logo Padding**: Reduced from `px-8` to `px-6`
- **Logo Image**: Reduced max-width from `300px` to `280px`
- **Navigation Section**: Increased from `max-w-3xl` to `max-w-4xl`
- **Button Spacing**: Reduced from `space-x-1` to `space-x-0.5`
- **Profile Section**: Increased from `max-w-xs` to `max-w-sm`, reduced margin from `ml-8` to `ml-6`
- **Button Optimization**: Reduced padding from `px-4` to `px-3` and min-width from `140px` to `130px`

**User Experience Impact**: ‚úÖ **HIGH** - Professional layout that accommodates all navigation elements without overlap

### 5. **Confirmation Dialog Standardization (RESOLVED)**
**Issue**: Double confirmation dialogs appearing (old browser confirm + new modal system).

**Root Cause**: Legacy `window.confirm()` calls coexisting with new ConfirmationModal system.

**Fix Applied**:
- **HaggaBasinPage.tsx**: Added ConfirmationModal import and state management
- **InteractiveMap.tsx**: Removed `window.confirm()` from onDelete handler
- Standardized all POI deletion to use styled ConfirmationModal across the application
- Consistent user experience for all destructive actions

**User Experience Impact**: ‚úÖ **MEDIUM** - Consistent, professional confirmation dialogs

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 6. **Real-time Data Synchronization (ENHANCED)**
**Improvements Made**:
- Enhanced error handling for deleted POIs in UPDATE events
- Added comprehensive filtering for subscription queries
- Improved fault tolerance with `.maybeSingle()` pattern
- Better state management for real-time updates

**Reliability Impact**: ‚úÖ **HIGH** - More robust real-time features with fewer errors

### 7. **Database Query Optimization (ENHANCED)**
**Improvements Made**:
- Consolidated user data fetching with proper relations
- Eliminated redundant database calls
- Improved query performance with proper indexing usage
- Better error handling for edge cases (deleted users, missing data)

**Performance Impact**: ‚úÖ **MEDIUM** - Faster page loads and reduced database overhead
