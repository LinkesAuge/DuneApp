# System Architecture: Dune Awakening Deep Desert Tracker

## 1. Overview

The Dune Awakening Deep Desert Tracker is a **production-ready** web application built with React (TypeScript) on the frontend and Supabase for backend services (Authentication, Database, Storage). The application provides comprehensive exploration tracking across multiple game regions: a grid-based map system for the Deep Desert region and an interactive coordinate-based map system for the Hagga Basin region.

**Status**: **100% COMPLETE & VERIFIED** - All architectural components are fully implemented, tested, and operationally verified. Final POI filter system bugs resolved January 3, 2025.

## 3. Data Flow - **COMPLETE ✅**

### 3.1. Standard User Operations
1.  **User Interaction**: User interacts with React components in their browser.
2.  **API Calls**: Frontend components make calls to Supabase services (Auth, Database, Storage, Edge Functions) via the Supabase client library.
3.  **Authentication**: Supabase Auth verifies user credentials and manages sessions. User roles determine access to features and data.
4.  **Data Operations**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the Supabase Database are performed according to RLS policies.
5.  **File Storage**: Screenshots and icons are uploaded to/retrieved from Supabase Storage, respecting bucket policies.
6.  **Edge Functions**: Specific backend logic (e.g., database management) is executed via serverless Edge Functions.

### 3.2. Admin Settings Flow - **NEW & COMPLETE ✅**
1.  **Settings Load**: Admin panel loads current settings from `app_settings` table on mount.
2.  **User Interaction**: Admin modifies settings via controlled form components.
3.  **State Management**: React state maintains current form values with validation.
4.  **Save Operation**: Admin clicks save, triggering database upsert to `app_settings`.
5.  **Real-time Application**: Settings changes apply immediately across the application.
6.  **Reset Functionality**: Admin can reset to defaults, clearing custom settings.

### 3.3. POI Position Change Flow - **NEW & COMPLETE ✅**
1.  **Edit Mode**: User opens POI edit modal from existing POI ✅
2.  **Map Interaction**: Interactive map enters position change mode with crosshair cursor ✅
3.  **Coordinate Capture**: User clicks new position on map ✅
4.  **Database Update**: POI coordinates updated in database with `custom_icon_id` support ✅
5.  **UI Refresh**: Map marker updates immediately to new position ✅
6.  **Edit Modal Closure**: Edit modal closes, returning user to updated map ✅

### 3.4. Map Initialization Optimization - **NEW & COMPLETE ✅**
1.  **Content-Type Detection**: Components identify map type (Hagga Basin 4000x4000px vs Deep Desert 2000x2000px).
2.  **Optimized Zoom Selection**: Automatic zoom level selection based on content dimensions:
   - Hagga Basin: 0.4 zoom for large maps (good overview)
   - Deep Desert: 0.8 zoom for smaller screenshots (compensates for size)
3.  **Library-Native Centering**: `react-zoom-pan-pinch`'s `centerOnInit: true` handles proper viewport positioning.
4.  **Elimination of Manual Positioning**: Removed all manual `setTransform` calls that caused visual jumping.
5.  **Professional Loading**: Maps appear immediately at optimal zoom and position without artifacts.

## 4. Key Architectural Decisions - **VALIDATED ✅**

-   **Serverless Backend**: Leveraging Supabase for BaaS (Backend as a Service) reduces server management overhead.
-   **Component-Based UI**: React promotes modular and reusable UI components.
-   **TypeScript**: Static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development and consistent styling.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforced at multiple levels (frontend UI, Supabase RLS) for security.
-   **JSON Configuration Storage**: Using `app_settings` table with JSON field for flexible admin configuration.
-   **Real-time Updates**: Optimized React components with proper state management for immediate UI updates.
-   **Controlled Components**: All admin forms use controlled inputs for predictable state management.

## 5. Directory Structure (Key Areas) - **ORGANIZED ✅**

-   `src/`: Contains all frontend source code.
    -   `components/`: Reusable React components, categorized by feature.
        -   `admin/`: Admin panel components including settings management
        -   `hagga-basin/`: Interactive map components with position change functionality
        -   `poi/`: Unified POI management components
        -   `common/`: Shared UI components
    -   `lib/`: Utility functions, Supabase client configuration.
    -   `pages/`: Top-level page components for routing.
    -   `types/`: TypeScript type definitions including admin settings.
-   `supabase/`: Contains backend configurations for Supabase.
