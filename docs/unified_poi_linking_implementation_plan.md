# Unified POI Linking System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Complete overhaul of POI linking system to create a unified, bidirectional interface that allows multiple POI and multiple item/schematic selection for bulk linking operations.

## Key Requirements
- **Replace** (not add to) the current `/pois/:id/link-items` page
- **Side-by-side layout**: POI panel (wider) | Items/Schematics panel
- **Selection summary** header showing current selections from both sides
- **Multiple entry points**: All existing chain link icons + new Database dropdown
- **Full filtering**: POI filters (like map pages) + Item/Schematic filters (like items/schematics page)
- **Map integration**: Keep both Hagga Basin and Deep Desert map views
- **Simplified linking**: Only "found_here" link type
- **Free-form selection**: Users can select from both sides in any order
- **Confirmation modal**: Shows all pending links, user confirms/cancels
- **Keep current design language**: Adapt existing styling to new layout
