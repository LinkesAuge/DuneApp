# Unified Screenshot System - Complete Integration Plan

**Date**: January 30, 2025  
**Objective**: Ensure 100% unified screenshot system integration across ALL components and data integrity  
**Status**: Core system working - Comprehensive audit and completion required  

## üéØ **ACCOMPLISHED TODAY: CORE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL + BUILD FIXES**

### **‚úÖ MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS:**

#### **1. CRITICAL BUILD SYSTEM FIXES (Current Session)**
- **Fixed**: Database table name `managed_images` vs `shared_images` in deletion functions
- **Fixed**: Duplicate imports in `GridPage.tsx` preventing compilation
- **Removed**: Legacy `pois_unified.ts` file (obsolete)
- **Result**: TypeScript compilation successful, dev server running, POI deletion working
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

#### **2. RLS POLICY RESOLUTION (Earlier)**
- **Fixed**: `poi_image_links` RLS policy violations preventing screenshot linking
- **Result**: Screenshots now properly link to POIs in database
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

#### **2. UNIFIED SCREENSHOT SYSTEM WORKING**
- **Implementation**: `useScreenshotManager` hook fully operational in POI edit modals
- **Features**: Upload, crop, edit, delete workflows all functional
- **Storage**: Clean two-folder architecture (poi_screenshots/, poi_cropped/)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **CORE SYSTEM COMPLETE**

#### **3. ADMIN DEVELOPER PANEL**
- **Location**: Navbar top-right (admin-only visibility)
- **Tools**: Screenshot Test, DB Test, Clear Console
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

- [ ] **Uses useScreenshotManager hook** (not old upload logic)
- [ ] **Properly handles crop workflow** (ImageCropModal integration)
- [ ] **Stores files in correct folders** (poi_screenshots/, poi_cropped/)
- [ ] **Creates database links** (poi_image_links, shared_images tables)
- [ ] **Handles editing workflow** (existing screenshot modification)
- [ ] **Provides user feedback** (upload progress, error handling)

#### **Database Cleanup Verification:**

#### **For Each Deletion Operation, Verify:**
