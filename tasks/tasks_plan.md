**Duration**: 1 development session  

#### **✅ Completed Deliverables:**
1. **✅ Schematic Indicator System**
   - Added schematic indicator icons (Scroll icon) on POI markers for linked schematics only
   - Purple color scheme for schematic indicators (`text-purple-400`)
   - Database query integration to check for linked schematics per POI

2. **✅ Tooltip Background Fix**
   - Changed from transparent gradient system to solid background matching POI modals
   - Improved readability and visual consistency

3. **✅ Indicator Positioning**
   - Privacy indicators: Repositioned to top-left (`-top-1 -left-1`)
   - Schematic indicators: Positioned to top-right (`-top-1 -right-1`)  
   - Increased schematic icon size from `w-4 h-4` to `w-5 h-5`

### **✅ PHASE 3 COMPLETED - Comprehensive UI Consistency**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Unified purple theming and proper capitalization across all components  
**Duration**: 1 development session  

#### **✅ Completed Deliverables:**
1. **✅ Consistent Capitalization**
   - Changed all "item"/"schematic" tags to "Item"/"Schematic" across the application
   - Updated tooltips, modals, and interface labels

2. **✅ Purple Schematic Theming**
   - `POIEntityLinkingModal.tsx`: Updated schematic tags to purple (`bg-purple-500/20 text-purple-300`)
   - `LinkedEntitiesSection.tsx`: Added Scroll icon and purple theming for schematic sections
   - `EntityCard.tsx`: Unified purple color scheme for schematic badges
   - `ItemsSchematicsContent.tsx`: Applied purple theming across all view modes (grid, list, tree)

3. **✅ Icon System Enhancement**
   - Replaced FileText icons with Scroll icons for schematics
   - Consistent purple color scheme (`text-purple-300 hover:text-purple-200`)
   - Proper icon sizing and positioning

### **✅ PHASE 4 COMPLETED - Final Polish & Functionality Enhancements**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Enhanced user experience and functionality  
**Duration**: 1 development session  

#### **✅ Completed Deliverables:**
1. **✅ Button Compactness & Styling**
   - Made linked items/schematics buttons more compact (`p-2` instead of `p-3`)
   - Reduced border radius from `rounded-lg` to `rounded`
   - Smaller icon sizes (`w-3.5 h-3.5` instead of `w-4 h-4`)
   - More compact text sizing (`text-sm font-medium`)

2. **✅ Navigation & Interaction Improvements**
   - External link buttons now navigate to database management page instead of non-existent detail pages
   - Added `stopPropagation` to prevent map highlight triggers when clicking linked item/schematic buttons
   - Enhanced user control and prevented unintended map interactions

3. **✅ Tier Display Standardization**
   - Updated `DetailsPanel.tsx` to use `getTierName()` function instead of hardcoded "Tier X"
   - Fixed test components (`POILinksTest.tsx`, `EntitiesAPITest.tsx`) to use proper tier names
   - Updated `POILinkManagerPage.tsx` tier displays

### **✅ PHASE 5 COMPLETED - Critical Database Integration Fix**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Fixed root cause of tier display issues  
**Duration**: 1 development session  

#### **✅ Completed Deliverables:**
1. **✅ Fixed getPoiWithEntities Function**
   - Root cause identified: `src/lib/api/poi-entity-links.ts` was hardcoding tier names as "Tier X"
   - Added database tier fetching to retrieve actual tier names
   - Created tierMap for efficient tier name lookup
   - Updated both items and schematics mapping to use real tier names

2. **✅ Database Query Optimization**
   - Fixed HTTP 400 error by removing non-existent 'color' column from tiers query
   - Maintained functionality with default amber color for all tiers
   - Proper error handling and fallback for missing tier data

3. **✅ End-to-End Verification**
   - All POI cards, panels, and modals now display correct tier names
   - LinkedItemsSection properly shows "Aluminum", "Plastanium", etc. instead of "Tier 4", "Tier 7"
   - Build successful with no errors
