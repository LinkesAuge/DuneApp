   - **Result**: POI deletion now works without database relationship errors
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

2. **Build System Resolution**:
   - **Fixed**: Removed duplicate imports in `GridPage.tsx` causing compilation errors
   - **Removed**: Legacy `pois_unified.ts` file (obsolete)
   - **Result**: TypeScript compilation successful, dev server running
   - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

#### **🔧 RLS Policy Resolution (Earlier)**

- **Result**: Screenshots now properly link to POIs in database
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

#### **📸 Unified Screenshot System Core Working**
- **Implementation**: `useScreenshotManager` hook fully operational in POI edit modals
- **Features**: Upload, crop, edit, delete workflows all functional
- **Storage**: Clean two-folder architecture (poi_screenshots/, poi_cropped/)
- **Status**: ✅ **CORE SYSTEM OPERATIONAL**

#### **🛠️ Admin Developer Panel**
- **Location**: Navbar top-right (admin-only visibility)
- **Tools**: Screenshot Test, DB Test, Clear Console
- **Design**: Dune aesthetic with purple overlays and amber text

- **Status**: **ACTIVELY DEBUGGING** - Runtime workflow investigation in progress

#### **✅ Verified Working**: 
- **POI Editing**: Screenshots work correctly in edit modals
- **POI Deletion**: Complete cleanup working across all pages
- **Comment System**: Screenshot upload operational

#### **🔍 Required System Audit (Next Phase):**

2. **Database Cleanup**: Ensure proper deletion of related data when objects removed
3. **Storage Cleanup**: Verify files are removed from storage when objects deleted
4. **Data Integrity**: Complete cleanup for POI, comment, and user deletion workflows

#### **📊 Components Requiring Verification:**
- **POI Creation Modals**: POIPlacementModal.tsx (debugging), AddPoiForm.tsx (needs verification)
- **Comment System**: CommentForm.tsx (working), comment deletion workflows
- **Grid Management**: Grid square screenshot upload/replacement
- **Deletion Processes**: POI (✅ fixed), comment, user deletion with complete cleanup

#### **🎯 Implementation Plan:**
- **Phase 1**: Component integration audit (1-2 sessions)
- **Phase 2**: Database cleanup verification (2-3 sessions)  
- **Phase 3**: Missing integrations implementation (2-3 sessions)
- **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing (1-2 sessions)
