# Task Plan: Dune Awakening Deep Desert Tracker

## Project Status: Initialized

## I. Completed Tasks

1.  **Project Setup & Initialization**
    *   [x] Review existing project documentation (`docs/DOCUMENTATION.md`).
    *   [x] Analyze project structure and key source files (`package.json`, `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/types/index.ts`).
    *   [x] Create `tasks/` directory.
    *   [x] Initialize core memory files:
        *   [x] `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`
        *   [x] `docs/architecture.md`
        *   [x] `docs/technical.md`
        *   [x] `tasks/tasks_plan.md` (this file)
        *   [x] `tasks/active_context.md`
    *   [x] Confirm existing rule files in `.cursor/rules/` (including `memory.mdc`, `error-documentation.mdc`, `lessons-learned.mdc`).

## II. Current Sprint / Immediate Next Steps

*   Define initial development tasks based on `docs/product_requirement_docs.md`.
*   Prioritize features for the first development sprint.
*   Set up project board or issue tracker (if applicable).
*   Begin development of core features (e.g., Authentication flow, Basic Grid display).

## III. Future Tasks / Backlog (High-Level from PRD)

*   **Authentication System**: Full implementation and testing of all user roles and permissions.
*   **Grid Map System**: Complete functionality for grid display, navigation, screenshot uploads, and exploration status.
*   **Points of Interest (POIs)**: Full CRUD for POIs, including type management, linking to grid, and screenshot uploads.
    *   [x] POI Type Management: Icon upload (using 'screenshots/icons/' bucket), display across components (`PoiCard`, `GridSquare`), transparent background option, and consistent styling (`PoiTypeManager.tsx`).
*   **Admin Panel**: Implement user management, POI type management, and database management features.
*   **Styling & UI/UX**: Refine UI based on the desert theme, ensure responsiveness, and apply UX best practices. Consider integration of Shadcn UI/Radix UI as per `ui-ux.mdc`.
*   **Testing**: Develop unit and integration tests for all major features.
*   **Database**: Finalize schema, RLS policies, and seed data. Test database functions.
*   **Edge Functions**: Implement and test `manage-database` and `get-user-emails` functions.
*   **Deployment**: Configure CI/CD pipeline for Netlify deployments.
*   **Documentation**: Continuously update all memory files and code documentation.

## IV. Known Issues / Technical Debt

*   (To be populated as development progresses)

## V. What Works

*   Basic project structure is in place.
*   Core dependencies are defined in `package.json`.
*   Supabase client is configured in `src/lib/supabase.ts`.
*   Core data types are defined in `src/types/index.ts`.
*   Memory system initialized.
*   POI Type icon management (upload, display, styling, transparent background) is functional in `PoiTypeManager.tsx`, `PoiCard.tsx`, and `GridSquare.tsx`.
