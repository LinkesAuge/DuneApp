2. **Phase 1B**: Implement guild database schema (4 hours)
3. **Phase 2A-B**: Update TypeScript interfaces for guild system (3 hours)
4. **Phase 3A**: Build guild CRUD API operations (4 hours)

**Core Features to Implement:**
- **Guild Management**: Admin interface for creating, editing, deleting guilds with customizable tag colors
- **User Organization**: Assign users to guilds with hierarchical roles (Leader, Officer, Member)
- **Visual Integration**: Display guild tags `Username [GuildName]` throughout application (~15 components)
