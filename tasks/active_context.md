### Hagga Basin Feature Requirements (Finalized)

**Core Specifications**:
1. **Coordinate System**: Pixel-based (0-4000) with conversion to CSS positioning
2. **Map Architecture**: Unified POI system with `map_type` field distinguishing "Deep Desert" vs "Hagga Basin"
3. **Interactive Features**: Zoom/pan with `react-zoom-pan-pinch`, touch gesture support
4. **Layer System**: Admin-managed base maps and overlays with opacity/ordering controls
5. **Privacy System**: Global/Private/Shared POI visibility with individual and collection-based sharing
6. **Custom Icons**: User-uploadable icons (1MB PNG, max 10 per user) with emoji picker integration
7. **Navigation**: New navbar item with dedicated page, integrated into existing POI page and dashboard
8. **Admin Management**: Separate admin section with simple up/down overlay controls

**Database Schema Design**:
- Extended `pois` table with `map_type`, `coordinates_x/y`, `privacy_level` fields
- New tables: `hagga_basin_base_maps`, `hagga_basin_overlays`, `poi_collections`, `poi_collection_items`, `poi_shares`, `custom_icons`
- Comprehensive RLS policies for privacy and user limits
- Extended storage structure with `hagga-basin/` and `custom-icons/` folders

## Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Database Schema (Ready to Start)

1. **Database Migration Development**:
   - Create migration to extend `pois` table with new fields
   - Migrate existing POIs to `map_type = 'deep_desert'`
   - Create all new supporting tables with proper relationships
   - Implement comprehensive RLS policies

2. **Storage Structure Setup**:
   - Create folder structure in Supabase Storage for Hagga Basin assets
   - Set up user-specific custom icon storage with proper policies

3. **Type Definitions Extension**:
   - Update TypeScript interfaces to support new map system
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing POI system

4. **Package Dependencies**:
   - Install `react-zoom-pan-pinch` for interactive map functionality
   - Any additional dependencies for coordinate conversion utilities

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Component Structure (Planned)
```
src/
├── pages/
│   └── HaggaBasinPage.tsx          # Main interactive map page
├── components/
│   ├── hagga-basin/
│   │   ├── InteractiveMap.tsx      # Zoom/pan container
│   │   ├── MapPOIMarker.tsx        # POI display markers
│   │   ├── MapOverlayControls.tsx  # Layer toggle panel
│   │   ├── BaseMapLayer.tsx        # Base map display
│   │   └── OverlayLayer.tsx        # Individual overlay
│   ├── admin/
│   │   └── HaggaBasinAdmin.tsx     # Admin management
│   └── common/
│       └── Navbar.tsx              # Updated with Hagga Basin link
```

### Key Implementation Patterns
- **Coordinate Conversion**: Pixel coordinates (0-4000) to CSS percentage positioning
- **Layer Management**: Z-index based layering (base map → overlays → POIs)
- **Performance**: React.memo for POI markers, memoized coordinate functions, debounced filtering
- **Privacy Filtering**: Query-level filtering based on user permissions and POI privacy levels

## Development Environment Status

- **Local Development**: Ready for Vite dev server with existing setup
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL ready for schema extension
- **Authentication**: Existing role-based access control will extend to new features
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage ready for new folder structure
- **Dependencies**: Need to install `react-zoom-pan-pinch` for map interactions

## Open Questions / Items for Discussion

1. **Development Priority**: Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation - should we proceed with database migrations?
2. **Testing Strategy**: Should we implement database migrations in a feature branch first?
3. **Performance Considerations**: Any concerns about 4000x4000px map performance that should be addressed upfront?
4. **User Experience**: Should we implement any onboarding/tutorial for the new interactive map features?
